Design Specs Transcript

You are listening to the audio description of the design specifications for Cosmethic Access. 
This recording lasts about one and a half minutes.

The prototype includes two products: one is a shampoo, and the other is a conditioner. 
Each product has its own tactile and visual language to aid identification. 
The bottles, labels, and pumps all use different shapes and colors so they can be distinguished easily.

Braille is embossed on the bottle and communicates the product name, along with the words “ingredients” and “scan me”.

The bottle body is rectangular, with chamfered edges. This improves grip and prevents the bottle from rolling away if dropped.

A reusable pump system is included for simple and controlled product dosage.

The front label uses high-contrast colors and a clear visual language to support quick product identification.

Finally, each bottle carries a Navilens code, which links to a digital label optimized for screen readers. 
The digital label provides ingredients, instructions, and important product information in an accessible format.

Thank you for listening. A transcript of this description is available next to the product.
