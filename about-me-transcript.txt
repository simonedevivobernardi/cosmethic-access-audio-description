About Me Transcript

You are listening to the audio description about the designer of Cosmethic Access.
This recording lasts about one minute.

Hello, my name is Simone De Vivo Bernardi. I’m an Italian-born, Sweden-based designer passionate about accessible, inclusive, sustainable, and regenerative design.

I hold a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Design + Change, where my thesis on accessible cosmetic packaging was shortlisted for international recognition.

Right now, I’m pursuing a Master’s in Embedded Design at HDK-Valand, University of Gothenburg.

My recent work includes creating an accessible cookbook, and exploring the intersection of design, food, and social impact through co-design with communities.

Thank you for listening. To learn more about my work, you can visit my website or ask a staff member for assistance.
