You are listening to the audio description for Cosmethic Access, part of this exhibition.
This recording lasts about two minutes.

The project is called Cosmethic Access — that’s spelled C-O-S-M-E-T-H-I-C, followed by the word Access. 
The name itself is a merge between the words cosmetic and ethic.

Hygiene and cosmetic products keep us clean, healthy and fresh, being essential to daily rituals of self-care. 

Over 30 million Europeans live with visual impairments, yet hygiene and cosmetic packaging remains largely exclusionary. 
Cosmethic Access demonstrates that designing with excluded communities is not only possible, but essential. 
The project was designed in collaboration with members of the Swedish Association for the Blind, whose insights directly shaped the outcomes: tactile ridges, braille, digital accessibility, and ergonomic forms.

The outcome is Lavamus, a speculative haircare brand whose name — Latin for “we wash ourselves” — underscores hygiene as a universal right. 
The bottles integrate several accessibility features: if you want to know more, listen to the audio description called “Design Specifications.”

Beyond the brand, Cosmethic Access reflects on how weaving together design thinking and inclusive design principles can build a process rooted in empathy and care. 
It shows that inclusive design is not only about adding accessibility features, but about rethinking the way we design products — involving, inviting, and advocating for the presence of people with disabilities in the design process itself. 

Thank you for listening.
