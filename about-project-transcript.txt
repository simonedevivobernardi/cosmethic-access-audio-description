About the Project Transcript

You are listening to the audio description for Cosmethic Access, part of this exhibition.
This recording lasts about two minutes.

The project is called Cosmethic Access — that’s spelled C-O-S-M-E-T-H-I-C, followed by the word Access. 
The name itself is a merge between the words cosmetic and ethic.

Hygiene and cosmetic products keep us clean, healthy and fresh, being essential to daily rituals of self-care. 
Cosmethic Access reframes “cosmetic” as Cosmethic — a fusion of beauty and ethics.

Over 30 million Europeans live with visual impairments, yet hygiene and cosmetic packaging remains largely exclusionary. 
Cosmethic Access demonstrates that designing with excluded communities is not only possible, but essential. 
The project was designed in collaboration with members of the Swedish Association for the Blind, whose insights directly shaped the outcomes: tactile ridges, braille, digital accessibility, and ergonomic forms.

The outcome is Lavamus, a speculative haircare brand whose name — Latin for “we wash ourselves” — underscores hygiene as a universal right. 
The bottles integrate several accessibility features: tactile ridges, distinct shapes and colors, high-contrast reliefs, and embossed braille for key information. 
The rectangular body with chamfered edges improves grip and prevents the bottle from rolling if dropped. 
A reusable pump ensures controlled dosing. 
A Navilens code links to a screen-reader-optimized digital label.

Beyond the brand, Cosmethic Access reflects on how weaving together design thinking and inclusive design principles can build a process rooted in empathy and care. 
It shows that inclusive design is not only about adding accessibility features, but about rethinking the foundations of everyday products to create dignity, independence, and equity.

Thank you for listening. To find out more, scan the Navilens code on the bottle, or refer to the transcript available next to this piece.
